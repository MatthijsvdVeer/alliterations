# Alliterations Generator

The Raspberry Pi in my kitchen is called "living-room-pi-2". Why? It was the second Pi in my living room... before I moved it.
I find alliterations to work well as hostnames because they're easy to remember (maybe not in your production env). To make this process easier I'm writing this alliteration generator.

## How to run the API.

Open a command prompt inside Alliterations.API and run `dotnet run`. The server will start on localhost:5001.
